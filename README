Twietry (like Twitter and Poetry) was a small project of implementing a bouts-rim√©s game with a web-interface and Twitter integration.

Now, there's nobody to work on this, so the website is closed. But anyone can use our codebase for free (or, coffee-ware) to improve it and set up their own website. Please, remember that 3 of images used on original website (app/assets/images/eye.png, app/assets/images/logo100.png, and app/assets/images/logo40.png) are CC-BY Xenia Selkova.

Please, let us know if you will use our code. Thanks.
